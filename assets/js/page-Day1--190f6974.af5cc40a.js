Where before I would strugle with what to draw to the DOM, now I'm working with multiple pages that have unique content that is generated based on a changing database. However, it does have it's drawbacks. Instead of the very straightforward controller->service->model, things become a bit more convoluted. Because you still have your services and models, but instead of controllers you have a network of pages and components that each have unique relationships, and the only way to figure out most of those relationships will be through hoping that whoever wrote it used a logical naming convention. In general reading component based architecture can be difficult. It's also an extremely robust and intricate framework, that quite frankly probably isn't necessary for anything we would write in this class, but it will save me TEE and headaches and I think I love VUE.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"afternoon-challenge"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#afternoon-challenge"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Afternoon Challenge")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("https://github.com/Chase16Rogers/vue-playground")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
