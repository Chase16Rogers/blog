Almost every struggle I was having with front-end development was blown away. Doing the checkpoint, things seemed to really click. I was evem enjoying the css. I won't say that I am perfectly comfortable or that my knowledge of vue is indomitable, but I think it was pretty easy to understand and implement.

I did have some trouble with scss not implementing, then the style tags wouldn't scope globally so I ended up copy pasting an unfortunate amount of styling.
