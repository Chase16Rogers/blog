Use a wireframe, then mark that wireframe with where my columns and rows go. This is good because when it comes time to put digital ink on digital paper, you don't have to create everything entirely from imagination. I feel like most of the code makes sense, I feel like I can relatively visualize how it should change the page, but once I get going maybe I don't layout the columns well, then all of a sudden things aren't moving when it's time to check how it looks on mobile. The other big tip was check after each line, I could throw a dozen lines of code up then check it, but if something went wrong, now I'm stuck trying to figure out exactly what broke it. But if you do it one line at a time, you can check that each line does what it's supposed to do before moving on.

If it's just an html page with a couple of buttons, I'm probably going to think it's a bit shady, like there wasn't much effort put into it. Where as a well designed website brings a good deal of the consumer's trust or even respect to a company. There is an immense amount of psychology involved in business and influencing a consumer. A website can convey just about anything a business wanted. The layout, colors, button positioning, etc... can all make a consumer more likely to make a purchase, more likely to think well of a particular brand. As long as the effort is made the sky is the limit. Finally if a website is annoying to navigate, people are going to be less likely to use it.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
