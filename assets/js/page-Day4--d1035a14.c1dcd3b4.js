The answer is mostly yes to wire-frame. When your starting from scratch, and have nothing more to go off of than your imagination, putting that image into code cleanly and effectively is a tall challenge. But you draw some pictures, figure out your layout, and have an actual idea on how everything should look and layout. Honestly, that\'s where it should stop. I would "never" (provisionally) go above a mid-fidelity, because of the modularity, the sheer control I have in the document. Why spend time and effort making a pretty picture no one but myself will see, when I can spend that time fideling with css properties, trying to make the actual webpage, work and look nice.')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=i.exports}}]);
