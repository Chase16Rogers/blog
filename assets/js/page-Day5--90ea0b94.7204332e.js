It felt good learning things I was barely able to follow along with during the intro to programming. One of my biggest dissapointments with moody kittens were some failures I had with altering the DOM, but in this checkpoint, while hitting many of the same roadblocks, I was actually able to overcome them and made my clicker work in a way that I'm actually mostly proud of. The array methods built into JS actually make sense, I cannot begin to describe how much difficulty I had trying to use the find method for moody kittens, but after it was explained in class it clicked, and I was able to use it successfully in the JS challenges. I am still very much enjoying learning how to code, and am looking forward to what next week will bring.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=i.exports}}]);
