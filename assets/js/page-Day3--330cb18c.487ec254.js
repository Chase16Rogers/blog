This is insanely useful to determine if things are running how I want. Did this variable come out to be what I expected? Did this if statement actually run the right code on true and false? There are so many points in code, that we just don\'t see, so it\'s very nice having a non-intrusive way of visualizing code.\nAnother way to write to the console is console.error(""). While very similar to console.log("") I feel like the use case for this is much more specific, and much less useful. In terms of me writing it, at this stage, into my code.\nFinally you could just write the code directly onto the command line. While very temporary, it could be good for testing out ideas that could be harmful to the functioning of other code, calling functions to make sure they actually work, and seeing how snippets of code could affect your website.')]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"elemental-my-dear-watson"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#elemental-my-dear-watson"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Elemental my dear Watson")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("The elements tab shows a breakdown of the HTML page and all the styling that goes along with it.

The elements tab gives a break down of every single visual component, where that code is coming from, and what makes it look like it looks. The pointer mode lets you quickly determine where something on screen is in the code. The styles bar on the right gives a play by play of what style is being applied to a particular element, it has a beautiful little diagram that describes the exact size of the element, its padding and margins, and it even allows you to add and adjust the styling to get the exact look you're going for. This all allows you to debug where a visual you don't want is coming from, and how changes to the style sheet will fix that particular bug.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"debugger"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#debugger"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" debugger")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("In JS the debugger keyword is a beautiful yet cruel mistress.
