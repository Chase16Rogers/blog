First of all it creates redundancy in where the code is stored. Not only is the code maintained on the initial computer that wrote it, it is uploaded to Git's servers. This way even if your local computer stops working, the code won't be lost. Second Git allows for extremely convenient collaboration. It allows for multiple people to push and pull code. On top of that it requires a message to describe any changes that were made. This way even if someone were to upload catastrophic code to the collective, it could easily be returned to a previous save.
